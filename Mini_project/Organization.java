// Create a program that simulates an organization with different types of employees and departments. The program should have the following classes/interfaces:
// Employee - This is an abstract class that has the properties of an employee such as name, age, salary, etc. It should have a constructor that initializes these properties, and getters and setters to access and modify them.
// Department - This is an abstract class that has the properties of a department such as name, budget, etc. It should have a constructor that initializes these properties, and getters and setters to access and modify them. It should also have an interface named "Operation" that has a method named "performOperation" which will be implemented by different department operations such as hiring, firing, budget allocation, etc.
// Manager - This is a derived class of the Employee class. It should have additional properties such as team, department, etc. It should have a constructor that initializes these properties, and getters and setters to access and modify them.
// Developer - This is a derived class of the Employee class. It should have additional properties such as technology, experience, etc. It should have a constructor that initializes these properties, and getters and setters to access and modify them.
// Marketing - This is a derived class of the Department class. It should have additional properties such as campaigns, events, etc. It should have a constructor that initializes these properties, and getters and setters to access and modify them. It should also implement the "Operation" interface with a method implementation of the "performOperation" method that will simulate marketing campaigns and events.
// IT - This is a derived class of the Department class. It should have additional properties such as technology, infrastructure, etc. It should have a constructor that initializes these properties, and getters and setters to access and modify them. It should also implement the "Operation" interface with a method implementation of the "performOperation" method that will simulate IT operations such as hiring, firing, and budget allocation.
// In the main method, create objects of different types of employees and departments, and simulate employee management and department operations by calling the "performOperation" method of the respective department.

// Description of code
// The Organization Management is a project that manages all employee details
// who belongs to particular department.instead of writing it manually we can
// manage data through this application .The program will have several classes
// and interfaces that will help achieve this goal.
// The first class is an abstract class called "Employee". This class will have
// the common properties that all employees share such as name, age, salary,
// etc.The second class is "Manager". This class will be derived from the
// "Employee" class and will have additional properties specific to the role of
// a manager. For example, a manager might have a team of employees that they
// are responsible for. We can define this property in the "Manager" class.The
// third class is called "Developer". This class will also be derived from the
// "Employee" class and will have additional properties specific to the role of
// a developerThe fourth class is an abstract class called "Department". This
// class will have common properties that all departments share such as name,
// budget, etc.The fifth class is called "Marketing". This class will be derived
// from the "Department" class and will have additional properties specific to
// the marketing department.The sixth class is called "IT". This class will also
// be derived from the "Department" class and will have additional properties
// specific to the IT department. For example, an IT department might have a
// list of servers that they are responsible for.The "Department" class should
// also have an interface called "Operation" which has a method called
// "performOperation" which will be implemented by different department
// operations.

// Finally, in the main method, objects of different types of employees and
// departments should be created and the "performOperation" method of the
// respective department should be called to simulate employee management and
// department operations.and if we run this code finally it will display all
// details of employee,manager,marketing,IT sector .
